                    <h2>Description of Services</h2>
                    <p>StoryKasa Services allow you to listen to audio stories or create audio stories on any
                        device. The Discover feature helps you to browse the StoryKasa public library, listen to
                        stories and save your favorites to your private library. The Create a Story feature lets
                        you create, save, and share your own stories in your private library. When you record a new
                        story you can add a title, description, age range, and upload illustrations. Your stories
                        will be visible to other profiles in your account. You can also choose to share your stories
                        with other friends and family using a link to a shared library. If you would like to share a
                        story with the public you can submit your story for review and we may accept it based on
                        certain assurances (e.g., is original or adapted and not under copyright) and
                        criteria (e.g., has good sound quality). If you do this and we approve your story it
                        will be converted to public and viewable by others. If you change your mind and would
                        like to convert your story back to private, please email us at help@storykasa.com and we
                        can help you with this.

                    <p>
                        StoryKasa provides a free tier of Services that is accessible to all and is designed to
                        reach as many children, families, and schools as possible without cost-based barriers. We
                        hope that stories and words can help language development and literacy, fuel
                        imagination, and build empathy and social connectedness.

                    <p>
                        We also have a premium paid tier of Services for families and schools who would like
                        additional features and services such as support for larger numbers of users, personalized
                        AI tools, and recording capabilities that exceed the one-hour limit in the free tier. Payments
                        in the premium tier can be made on a monthly or annual basis, are non-refundable, and will
                        be charged to your payment method on the billing date indicated. The length of your billing
                        cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you sign-up for the
                        service. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or
                        otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to Services until
                        we have successfully charged a valid payment method. You can cancel your premium membership
                        at any time, and you will continue to have access to StoryKasa Services through the end of
                        your billing period. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our Services from
                        time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply at
                        least 30 days after we notify you.
