        question: "Does kasa mean anything? Why did you choose the name “StoryKasa”?",
        text: `Kasa has many meanings that capture our vision for the storytelling platform. Kasa means “to speak or 
        talk” in Twi, which is a widely spoken language in Ghana. It also means “umbrella” in Japanese. And, when 
        spelled as casa it means “home” in Spanish. So, the meaning of StoryKasa is something like “a home or umbrella
         for spoken stories.”`
